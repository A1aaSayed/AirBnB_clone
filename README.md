## Description
The AirBnB Clone Project is an ambitious endeavor aimed at replicating the foundational aspects of the popular AirBnB platform. This project encompasses a series of tasks and objectives that progressively build a comprehensive web application. The initial focus involves developing a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects, setting the stage for subsequent projects that include HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API integration, and front-end development.

## Description of the command interpreter
The AirBnB Clone Command Interpreter is a Python-based tool designed to manage AirBnB objects within the application. It serves as a command-line interface for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting objects, providing users with a convenient way to interact with the system.

### How to Start
1. Clone the project to your local machine "https://github.com/A1aaSayed/AirBnB_clone.git"
2. Navigate to the directory
3. Run the command ./console.py to launch the command interpreter

### How to Use
Once the command interpreter is running, you can interact with it using the following way:
`(hbnb) <command> [agruments]`

### Examples
##### 1. Creating an Object:
`(hbnb) create User`
##### 2. Showing Object Information:
`(hbnb) show User`
##### 3. Updating Object Attributes:
`(hbnb) update User name Alaa`
##### 4. Destroying an Object:
`(hbnb) destroy User`
##### 5. Listing All Objects of a Class:
`(hbnb) all User`
##### 6. Exiting the Command Interpreter:
`(hbnb) quit`
