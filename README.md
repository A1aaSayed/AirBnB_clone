## Description
The AirBnB Clone Project is an ambitious endeavor aimed at replicating the foundational aspects of the popular AirBnB platform. This project encompasses a series of tasks and objectives that progressively build a comprehensive web application. The initial focus involves developing a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects, setting the stage for subsequent projects that include HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API integration, and front-end development.
